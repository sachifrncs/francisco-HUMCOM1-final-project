            <p>This semester in Human-Computer Interaction was a very interesting experience. I enjoyed learning how technology is designed not just to work, but to be easy and enjoyable for people to use.

               
                
                </p>
            
            <p> Doing activities like usability testing helped me see how small design choices affect users. Some exercises were challenging, but they taught me to think creatively and pay attention to details.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, HCI made me more aware of the user experience. I want to use what I learned to create designs that are simple, useful, and user-friendly in the future.</p>
